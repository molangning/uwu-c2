# uwu-c2

Normal c2 channels are boring, so let's make them fun!

This uwu-obfuscator encodes your chosen data in base32 before substituting the characters with various "uwu" words. Obfuscated data have the benefit of being low in entropy and confuzzling the defenders when they analyze the traffic.

DO NOT USE THIS IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT! This was meant to be a joke and a example of a c2 detection evasion technique. If you still want to use it, change the `map.json` file and/or use base64 for denser data encoding.
